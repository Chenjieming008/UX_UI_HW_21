                    <h2>Jack He's Story</h2>
                    <p>From a young age, I've always had a passion for design. I spent my childhood sketching, drawing, and getting lost in my imaginative creations. Cars, in particular, fascinated me. Iâ€™m also a car guy, in my free time, I loved to redesign car exteriors, interiors, and especially digital gauges. I always aimed to design them in a way that aligns with my vision of an ideal automobile brand.</p>
                    <p>In college, I shifted from a design major to business administration due to financial constraints. Later, I co-founded a clothing brand with friends, taking charge of design, from our site to the clothes, and photo edits. Despite the challenges, it emphasized my true passion for design. While I earned good money as an agent and salesman, my heart always gravitated towards design. Now, I'm chasing my real dream.</p>
                    <p>Building on my foundational passion for design and business acumen, I recently took my skills to the next level by completing a rigorous bootcamp at Columbia University. There, I delved into UX/UI design and coding, which not only honed my technical abilities but also refined my approach to user-centered design solutions. This hands-on experience has prepared me to tackle real-world challenges, despite my brief professional background in the field. I'm a dedicated and agile learner, eager to apply my fresh and robust skillset to create impactful and engaging user experiences that drive business success.</p>
